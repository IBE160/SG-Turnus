This document outlines the project plan for "The AI Helping Tool." It covers implementation readiness and sprint planning.

## 1. Implementation Readiness

The project is now ready for implementation. The following documents have been created and reviewed:

*   [Architecture](docs/architecture.md)
*   [Epics and User Stories](docs/epics-and-stories.md)

The next step is to create a more detailed technical design and to set up the development environment.

## 2. Sprint Planning

The first sprint will focus on setting up the development environment and implementing a basic version of the "Core 'Instant Clarity' Experience."

**Sprint 1 Goals:**

*   Set up the development environment, including the mobile application, backend, and AI service.
*   Implement a basic user interface for the mobile application.
*   Implement a basic backend that can receive text input from the mobile application and send it to the AI service.
*   Integrate with a third-party AI service to provide a single, actionable next step from text input.

**Sprint 1 Stories:**

*   As a user, I want to be able to enter text into the tool so that I can get an actionable next step.
*   As a user, I want to receive a single, concise next step so that I can quickly understand what to do next.
