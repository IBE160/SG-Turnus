# Story Quality Validation Report

Story: EPIC-1-STORY-1.1 - Project Initialization and SPA Scaffolding
Outcome: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 1, Minor: 2)

## Critical Issues (Blockers)


## Major Issues (Should Fix)

- ACs are not explicitly referenced by tasks: The tasks in the story do not explicitly link back to the acceptance criteria using the "(AC: #)" format. This reduces traceability between implementation steps and desired outcomes.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

- Lack of explicit testing subtasks for each AC: While "verifying basic setup" is mentioned, there are no specific testing subtasks outlined for each acceptance criterion, which would improve test coverage clarity.
- Change Log missing: The story document is missing an initialized "Change Log" section, which is important for tracking revisions.

## Successes

- Story Continuity Check: Passed (First story in epic, no previous story to link to).
- Source Document Coverage Check: Passed (Epics, PRD, and Architecture documents are correctly cited with section references).
- Acceptance Criteria Quality Check: Passed (ACs are testable, specific, atomic, and directly match those from the epics.md).
- Dev Notes Quality Check: Passed (Specific architectural guidance and relevant references are provided).
- Story Structure Check: Mostly passed (Status, Story format, and Dev Agent Record sections are correctly structured).
