PRD Prompt 1 — Project Purpose & Problem Definition

Prompt (high-level):
“Tell me what you want to build — what problem does it solve and for whom?”

Condensed Response Summary:
The product is a web-based AI study assistant designed to reduce cognitive overload for students. It transforms confusion into clarity by providing a single actionable next step generated from any academic input. It is intended for high school, university, and adult learners who struggle with uncertainty and inefficient study methods.

PRD Prompt 2 — Vision Alignment & Differentiation

Prompt:
“Define the vision and explain what makes this product unique.”

Condensed Response Summary:
The vision is to deliver instant clarity through ultra-low-friction interaction. The differentiator is the Zero-Friction Instant Clarity Engine, which generates exactly one targeted next step instead of overwhelming users with options or long explanations. This challenges conventional assumptions about how students interact with study tools.

PRD Prompt 3 — Empathy Map (Advanced Elicitation)

Prompt:
“Apply the Empathy Map to deeply understand what students think, feel, see, say, do, and their pains/gains.”

Condensed Response Summary:
Students feel overwhelmed and uncertain, struggle to know where to start, and procrastinate due to cognitive load. They need clear direction, small actionable steps, and emotional reassurance. Gains include clarity, confidence, momentum, and reduced stress. This defines the core UX and product value.

PRD Prompt 4 — Success Criteria

Prompt:
“What defines ‘winning’? How do we measure reduced cognitive load and increased learning momentum?”

Condensed Response Summary:
Success is defined by time-to-clarity under 10 seconds, high micro-engagement activation, sustained multi-step interaction, reduced decision paralysis, strong user trust, and evidence of learning momentum. The product succeeds when students consistently move from confusion to productive action.

PRD Prompt 5 — Scope Definition (MVP / Growth / Vision)

Prompt:
“Define the MVP, Growth Features, and long-term Vision.”

Condensed Response Summary:
MVP includes text and image input, core interpretation pipeline, single-step generation, micro-engagement loop, and zero-friction design. Growth features include voice input, concept snapshots, misconceptions detection, quizzes, personalization, and multi-step workflows. Vision includes deep multimodal understanding, adaptive learning intelligence, proactive guidance, and an integrated learning ecosystem.

PRD Prompt 6 — Innovation Analysis

Prompt:
“What makes this new? What assumptions does it challenge? How do we validate it? What’s the fallback? Has anyone done this before?”

Condensed Response Summary:
The innovation lies in shifting from information-heavy assistance to action-first clarity. It challenges the belief that more options or explanations are better. Validation focuses on metrics like engagement, clarity, and emotional load. A fallback exists where users can choose alternate steps. Similar approaches appear in other domains but not in education at this depth.

PRD Prompt 7 — Web App Requirements (SPA, Browser Support, SEO, Real-Time, Accessibility)

Prompt:
“Define technical parameters like SPA/MPA, browser support, SEO needs, real-time requirements, and accessibility scope.”

Condensed Response Summary:
The tool is a SPA with support for modern browsers. SEO is minimal for MVP. Real-time collaboration is not required, but perceived instant feedback is. Accessibility focuses on simplicity and readability rather than formal compliance levels.

PRD Prompt 8 — UX Principles

Prompt:
“How should the tool feel? What key interaction patterns and critical user flows define the experience?”

Condensed Response Summary:
The experience must feel calm, direct, and confidence-building. Key patterns include single input → single next step, micro-engagement loops, progressive reveal, and clear system state. Critical flows include: instant clarity, misalignment correction, switching inputs, momentum-building, and graceful recovery from errors.

PRD Prompt 9 — Functional Requirements

Prompt:
“Specify all functional requirements of the system.”

Condensed Response Summary:
FRs include input handling, OCR, interpretation pipeline, next-step engine, micro-engagement loop, UI behaviors, error-handling, user accounts, security, cloud storage, personalization, sharing, and growth features such as voice input and concept snapshots. Total: 46 FRs.

PRD Prompt 10 — Non-Functional Requirements

Prompt:
“Define quality attributes: Performance, Security, Scalability, Accessibility, Integration.”

Condensed Response Summary:
NFRs include strict response times (1–3 seconds), encryption standards, GDPR compliance, concurrency goals, scalable cloud architecture, simplified accessibility guidelines, LLM integration, analytics pipelines, and optional future LMS integration. Total: 21 NFRs.
