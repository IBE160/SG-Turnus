- I want to brainstorm the user flow of the web application towards the student and how they will navigate through the website. 

- The primary stages and key interactions will be:
1. The conclusions
2. The flashcards
3. The quiz answers
4. Key learning points from each study book

- For the flashcards interaction, there would be:
- To view flashcards
- To create flashcards
- Quiz with the flashcards

- For the conclusions, I want them to be able to put in small fragments of the learning book towards having a conclusion of the stuff they put in, to have it more focused towards the exams. 

For the quiz answers, this should be taken out from the correct Liam that they have in each study group, and give them relevant quiz questions so they can answer within that. 

What I mean by key learning points from each study book is that it will take out the unnecessary information, and you will be left with what you need to learn for exams, making it shorter time to learn, and you will memorize it better.
