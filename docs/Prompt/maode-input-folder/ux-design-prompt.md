- he core experience for "The AI Helping Tool" is the seamless and        
  immediate interaction with the AI for instant clarity and guidance. Users
  will most frequently engage with the AI to receive a single, most helpful
  next step related to their study materials. It should be absolutely      
  effortless for users to input their study content and receive            
  context-aware summaries and insights. The most critical user action to   
  get right is the initial submission of study material and the subsequent 
  AI-driven interaction that provides clarity and direction.
