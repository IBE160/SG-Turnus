1. Yes, the user will ask for clarity when they're stuck, but it should also be a tool to expand the learning by giving them summaries, flashcards, and other objectives to move on throughout the study course. They should be able to put in from the textbook and ask questions that would reflect to their study. The plan is to use a mobile app like iOS and Android, and also have a web application where they should be able to log in and follow up on the learning they have done. 

2. If we are going to look at what they feel after they've used the app and the first bit of clarity, I want them to be relieved and calm for actually using the app and wanting to continue to learn. After that, I want them to become efficient and productive, to learn more of what the study can provide... In a good way so it doesn't get overwhelming.
