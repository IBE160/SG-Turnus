# Research Findings: First Interaction Patterns for Zero-Friction Learning
1. Overview

This document identifies first-interaction patterns that can be applied across different user inputs. The patterns focus on lowering cognitive load, engaging the learner, and creating immediate clarity.

Each pattern includes purpose, structure, usage conditions, and strengths.

2. Pattern: Anchor Question

Purpose: Establish the core idea the user must understand before anything else.
Structure:

One-sentence extraction of the central concept.

A short question prompting the user to restate or interpret it.

Usage:

Dense paragraphs

Concept-heavy material

When user intent is unclear

Strengths:

Creates instant grounding

Encourages active recall

3. Pattern: Micro-Explanation + Quick Check

Purpose: Provide a tiny explanation followed by a simple check for understanding.
Structure:

Two-sentence explanation

A yes/no or 1-sentence question

Usage:

Medium clarity inputs

Concepts with predictable structure

Strengths:

Reduces overwhelm

Gives immediate reinforcement

4. Pattern: One-Second Calibration Question

Purpose: Quickly determine what the user is trying to achieve with minimal effort.
Structure:

A micro-question about goal, domain, or difficulty

Usage:

Low-confidence inference

Fragmented or ambiguous input

Strengths:

Prevents misalignment

Keeps friction extremely low

5. Pattern: Problem Decomposition Step

Purpose: Break a problem into its smallest actionable unit.
Structure:

Identify “Step 1”

Ask user to confirm or compute that part

Usage:

Exercises, equations, diagrams

Long problems

Strengths:

Makes complex tasks manageable

Immediate sense of progress

6. Pattern: Concept Snapshot

Purpose: Show a micro-map of connected ideas.
Structure:

Three-item list or tiny diagram in text form

Ask user to select which part they want to explore

Usage:

Multi-topic passages

Early-stage exploration

Strengths:

Gives structure without heaviness

Encourages autonomy without overwhelm
