### Story Context Assembly Checklist
Pass Rate: 8/8 (100%)

✓ Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured
Evidence: `<asA>developer</asA>` (L13), `<iWant>set up a new Flutter project with the standard folder structure</iWant>` (L14), `<soThat>we have a clean, consistent foundation for building the UI and client-side logic</soThat>` (L15)

✓ Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)
Evidence: The acceptance criteria (L37-40) directly and verifiably support the story's "iWant" (L14) and "soThat" (L15) statements.

✓ Tasks/subtasks captured as task list
Evidence: The `<tasks>` section (L16-33) contains a clearly structured list of tasks and subtasks using markdown bullet points.

✓ Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
Evidence: 8 documents with paths and snippets are included under `<artifacts><docs>` (L43-85).

➖ N/A - Relevant code references included with reason and line hints
Evidence: The `<code>` section (L93) is empty. For an initial frontend application story, it's appropriate that no existing code references are present.

➖ N/A - Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable
Evidence: The `<interfaces>` section (L124) is empty. For an initial frontend application story, API interface definition is outside the scope of this particular setup story.

✓ Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns
Evidence: The `<constraints>` section (L102-121) clearly outlines framework, design system, typography, project structure, and target platform constraints.

✓ Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks
Evidence: The `<dependencies>` section (L94-98) lists Flutter SDK as a framework dependency.

✓ Testing standards and locations populated
Evidence: The `<tests>` section (L125-139) specifies manual verification standards, testing locations, and provides detailed test ideas.

✓ XML structure follows story-context template format
Evidence: The document `1-1-initialize-frontend-application.context.xml` adheres to a well-defined XML structure, starting with `<story-context>` and containing expected top-level elements such as `metadata`, `story`, `acceptanceCriteria`, `artifacts`, `constraints`, `interfaces`, and `tests` (entire document).
