# Story 3.4: Quality Assurance for Generated Materials

As a user,
I want to trust that the generated summaries, flashcards, and quizzes are accurate and relevant to my study materials,
So that I can rely on them for effective learning.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** generated study materials
**When** the system performs quality assurance
**Then** the output content is factually consistent with the source material (accuracy).
**And** the output content addresses the key themes and concepts of the source material (relevance).
**And** the output content matches the requested detail level or complexity.
**And** mechanisms for user feedback on quality are available (e.g., "Is this helpful?").

**Prerequisites:** Story 3.1, 3.2, 3.3

**Technical Notes:** Covers FR8. This involves evaluation metrics for generated text, possibly incorporating user feedback loops to improve model performance over time.
