- Critical Issues: 8

## Section Results

### Overall Document Structure
Pass Rate: 3/3 (100%)

✓ Overview clearly ties to PRD goals
Evidence: "This technical specification details the implementation plan for Epic 1... As outlined in the PRD, this involves creating a secure, scalable, and reliable infrastructure..." (Lines 9-13)

✓ Scope explicitly lists in-scope and out-of-scope
Evidence: Explicit "In-Scope" and "Out-of-Scope" bullet points (Lines 20-41)

✓ Design lists all services/modules with responsibilities
Evidence: "### Services and Modules" table (Lines 57-79)

### Detailed Design
Pass Rate: 0/4 (0%)

✗ Data models include entities, fields, and relationships
Evidence: Placeholder '{{data_models}}' is present.
Impact: Essential for database design and implementation.

✗ APIs/interfaces are specified with methods and schemas
Evidence: Placeholder '{{apis_interfaces}}' is present.
Impact: Critical for frontend-backend integration.

✗ NFRs: performance, security, reliability, observability addressed
Evidence: Placeholders '{{nfr_performance}}', '{{nfr_security}}', '{{nfr_reliability}}', '{{nfr_observability}}' are present.
Impact: Non-functional requirements are vital for system quality and success.

✗ Dependencies/integrations enumerated with versions where known
Evidence: Placeholder '{{dependencies_integrations}}' is present.
Impact: Necessary for clear development and build processes.

### Requirements Traceability
Pass Rate: 0/4 (0%)

✗ Acceptance criteria are atomic and testable
Evidence: Placeholder '{{acceptance_criteria}}' is present.
Impact: Needed for clear testing and definition of "done."

✗ Traceability maps AC → Spec → Components → Tests
Evidence: Placeholder '{{traceability_mapping}}' is present.
Impact: Ensures all requirements are covered from design to testing.

✗ Risks/assumptions/questions listed with mitigation/next steps
Evidence: Placeholder '{{risks_assumptions_questions}}' is present.
Impact: Important for proactive project management.

✗ Test strategy covers all ACs and critical paths
Evidence: Placeholder '{{test_strategy}}' is present.
Impact: Ensures adequate testing coverage.

## Failed Items
- **Data models include entities, fields, and relationships:** Placeholder '{{data_models}}' is present.
- **APIs/interfaces are specified with methods and schemas:** Placeholder '{{apis_interfaces}}' is present.
- **NFRs: performance, security, reliability, observability addressed:** Placeholders '{{nfr_performance}}', '{{nfr_security}}', '{{nfr_reliability}}', '{{nfr_observability}}' are present.
- **Dependencies/integrations enumerated with versions where known:** Placeholder '{{dependencies_integrations}}' is present.
- **Acceptance criteria are atomic and testable:** Placeholder '{{acceptance_criteria}}' is present.
- **Traceability maps AC → Spec → Components → Tests:** Placeholder '{{traceability_mapping}}' is present.
- **Risks/assumptions/questions listed with mitigation/next steps:** Placeholder '{{risks_assumptions_questions}}' is present.
- **Test strategy covers all ACs and critical paths:** Placeholder '{{test_strategy}}' is present.

## Recommendations
1. **Must Fix:** Complete all remaining sections in the Epic Technical Specification: 'Data Models and Contracts', 'APIs and Interfaces', 'Non-Functional Requirements', 'Dependencies and Integrations', 'Acceptance Criteria', 'Traceability Mapping', 'Risks, Assumptions, Open Questions', and 'Test Strategy Summary'. These are critical for a complete technical specification.
2. **Should Improve:** Ensure all placeholders are replaced with detailed, concrete technical specifications.
