## Failed Items
(None)

## Partial Items
- **Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets**
  - **What's missing:** More relevant documents could be included, especially from `prd.md` and other documentation linked in the original story's references.
- **Relevant code references included with reason and line hints**
  - **What's missing:** The code references are missing specific line number hints, which would improve clarity for developers.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: (None)
2. Should Improve:
    - Increase the number of referenced documents in the `artifacts.docs` section to provide a more comprehensive context (aim for 5-15). Consider including snippets from `prd.md`.
    - Add line number hints to the code references in the `artifacts.code` section to guide developers more precisely.
3. Consider: (None)
