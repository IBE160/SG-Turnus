# Story 1.5: Cloud Storage Setup for User Content

Status: drafted

## Story

As a developer,
I want to set up a secure and scalable cloud object storage (e.g., Amazon S3) for user-uploaded study materials and AI-generated content,
So that the application can reliably store and manage user data while adhering to data privacy and security standards.

## Requirements Context Summary

This story, "Cloud Storage Setup for User Content," is part of Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure. It directly addresses Functional Requirements FR12 (Cloud Storage & Processing) and FR13 (Data Security) by establishing the necessary cloud infrastructure for data storage.

From the Product Requirements Document (PRD), the system needs to:
- Securely store and process uploaded study materials and generated content in a cloud-based environment (FR12).
- Implement robust data security measures, including encryption for data at rest (FR13).

The Architecture document provides further guidance:
- **Decision:** File Storage will use Object Storage (e.g., Amazon S3). PostgreSQL will store only metadata and references to these files.
- **Integration Points:** The Python Backend will securely handle the upload and retrieval of raw user study materials to and from S3.
- **High Security Strategy:** Emphasizes encryption at rest and strict access control, which is directly relevant to configuring access policies for the storage bucket.
- **Scalability Strategy:** Object storage supports the multi-layered scalability approach.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Given** user content needs to be stored
    **When** the cloud storage is configured
    **Then** a cloud storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) is created.
2.  **And** access policies are configured to ensure data is private by default.
3.  **And** the application backend has the necessary credentials and permissions to upload, download, and manage files in the bucket.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task: Provision cloud storage bucket (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Subtask: Select cloud provider (AWS S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage)
  - [ ] Subtask: Create a new storage bucket
  - [ ] Subtask: Configure bucket region and basic settings
  - [ ] Subtask: Implement unit/integration tests for bucket provisioning verification
- [ ] Task: Configure access policies and permissions (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Subtask: Define bucket policies to ensure private access by default
  - [ ] Subtask: Create IAM user/role with least-privilege permissions for bucket operations
  - [ ] Subtask: Configure backend service with credentials to access the bucket
- [ ] Task: Implement backend service for file operations (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Subtask: Develop API endpoints for uploading files (e.g., `/api/v1/user-content/upload`)
  - [ ] Subtask: Develop API endpoints for downloading files (e.g., `/api/v1/user-content/download/{file_id}`)
  - [ ] Subtask: Develop API endpoints for managing files (e.g., listing, deleting)
  - [ ] Subtask: Integrate with selected cloud storage SDK
  - [ ] Subtask: Implement unit tests for backend file operations using Pytest [Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
  - [ ] Subtask: Implement integration tests for file upload/download workflows
- [ ] Task: Update database schema for file metadata (AC: N/A - implicit from architecture)
  - [ ] Subtask: Add `s3_key` (or equivalent) field to `StudyMaterial` model [Source: architecture.md#Data Architecture]
## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints: Object Storage (e.g., Amazon S3), encryption at rest, secure access policies for backend services.
- Source tree components to touch: `backend/app/models/` for `StudyMaterial` schema, `backend/app/services/` for file handling logic, `backend/app/api/` for new endpoints.
- Testing standards summary: Unit and Integration tests for file operations.

### Project Structure Notes

- The `StudyMaterial` model in `backend/app/models/` will be updated to include references to stored files (e.g., `s3_key`). New services will be created in `backend/app/services/` for interacting with cloud storage APIs.
