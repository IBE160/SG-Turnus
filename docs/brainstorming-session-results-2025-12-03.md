### SCAMPER: Feature Ideation Summary 

 

**Substitute:** 

*   **Multimodal Understanding**: Process diagrams, audio, and handwriting, not just text. 

*   **Concept Graph Summarization**: Build summaries from a map of conceptual relationships. 

*   **Conversational Recall**: Replace static flashcards with interactive dialogues. 

*   **Adaptive Difficulty Quizzes**: Quizzes that evolve based on user performance. 

*   **Context-Aware Source Linking**: Link summary points directly back to their source in the material. 

 

**Combine:** 

*   **Integrated "Learning Packages"**: Fuse summaries, flashcards, and quizzes into a single, coherent output. 

*   **Hybrid Knowledge Base**: Blend user notes and annotations directly with AI-generated content. 

*   **Spaced Repetition Scheduling**: Combine the study schedule with quiz creation for strategic, timed reviews. 

*   **Adaptive Feedback Loop**: Use performance analytics to generate targeted mini-summaries for weak spots. 

 

**Adapt:** 

*   **"Skill Tree" Progression**: Adapt game-like skill trees for a visual map of learning progress. 

*   **Achievement & Badge System**: Adapt game achievements to motivate users and inform the AI. 

*   **Social Media "Content Feed"**: Present study items in a dynamic, personalized feed. 

*   **Kanban Board Workflow**: Adapt project management boards for a visual study pipeline (e.g., To Review, Mastered). 

 

**Modify:** 

*   **(Magnify) Layered Explanation Engine**: Create deep, multi-level explanations that a user can explore. 

*   **(Magnify) Gamified Quiz Arena**: Make quizzes a central, competitive, and game-like feature. 

*   **(Minify) "Survival Guide" Generator**: A one-click feature for the absolute most critical information. 

*   **(Minify) Time-Bounded Outputs**: Summaries designed to be consumed in a set amount of time (e.g., 5 minutes). 

 

**Put to Other Uses:** 

*   **For Educators**: A tool for lesson planning and creating teaching assets. 

*   **For Corporate Training**: An engine for streamlining onboarding and compliance. 

*   **For Content Creators**: An editorial assistant for refining articles and scripts. 

*   **For General Productivity**: A cognitive assistant for summarizing meeting notes or personal journals. 

 

**Eliminate:** 

*   **Upfront Configuration**: Automate settings to create a one-click "Process" experience. 

*   **Mandatory Accounts**: Offer a "guest mode" for instant access and utility. 

*   **Text-First Assumptions**: Embrace purely visual outputs like diagrams and concept maps. 

 

**Rearrange/Reverse:** 

*   **Quiz-First Processing (Test -> Tailor -> Teach)**: Use a diagnostic quiz to determine the type of summary to generate. 

*   **User Actions Train the AI**: The user's edits and corrections actively improve the AI model over time. 

*   **"Learning Gap" Focus**: Generate content specifically targeted at areas where the user is weakest.
