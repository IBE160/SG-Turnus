# Story 3.3: Automated Quiz Question Generation

As a user,
I want the system to automatically generate quiz questions (e.g., multiple choice, true/false) from my study materials,
So that I can assess my understanding.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an uploaded study material (text) and a request for quiz generation
**When** the system processes the material
**Then** it generates a set of diverse quiz questions based on the content.
**And** the questions include correct answers and plausible distractors (for multiple choice).
**And** the quiz is presented in an interactive format.

**Prerequisites:** Epic 2

**Technical Notes:** Covers FR7. Similar to flashcard generation, but with a focus on creating assessment-style questions.
