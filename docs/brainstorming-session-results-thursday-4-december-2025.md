## Technique Sessions

### Mind Mapping Session - Student User Flow and Web Application Navigation

**Main Branches and Sub-Branches Identified:**

*   **The conclusions**
    *   Input fragments from learning materials: Ability to put in small fragments of the learning book.
    *   Synthesize into conclusions: Towards having a conclusion of the stuff they put in.
    *   Exam-focused: To have it more focused towards the exams.
*   **The flashcards**
    *   To view flashcards
    *   To create flashcards
    *   Quiz with the flashcards
*   **The quiz answers**
    *   Curated from study groups (from Liam): Quiz questions taken out from the correct Liam that they have in each study group.
    *   Interactive answering: Students can answer within the platform.
    *   Relevant questions: Give them relevant quiz questions so they can answer within that.
*   **Key learning points from each study book**
    *   Filter unnecessary information: It will take out the unnecessary information.
    *   Optimize learning time: You will be left with what you need to learn for exams, making it shorter time to learn.
    *   Enhance memorization: You will memorize it better.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_Ideas ready to implement now_

*   **View Flashcards**: Basic functionality for students to access pre-made or self-created flashcards.
*   **Interactive Quizzing**: Implementing basic quiz answering features for relevant questions.
*   **Basic Note Extraction**: Allowing students to input fragments of text for personal conclusions.

### Future Innovations

_Ideas requiring development/research_

*   **Create Flashcards**: Advanced functionality for students to generate their own flashcards from study material.
*   **Smart Conclusion Synthesis**: AI-assisted summarization of input fragments for exam-focused conclusions.
*   **Dynamic Quiz Generation**: Leveraging Liam's insights for real-time, relevant quiz question generation.
*   **Automated Key Learning Extraction**: Systematically identifying and distilling exam-relevant points from study books to optimize learning and memorization.

### Moonshots

_Ambitious, transformative concepts_

*   **Adaptive Learning Paths**: A system that dynamically adjusts content presentation (e.g., flashcards, quizzes, conclusions) based on individual student performance and memorization patterns to drastically shorten learning time and improve retention across all subjects.
*   **Collaborative Conclusion Building**: A feature allowing students within a study group to collectively build and refine exam-focused conclusions, leveraging shared insights and Liam's expertise.

### Insights and Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

The user places a high value on efficiency and targeted learning, particularly for exam preparation. The emphasis on distilling information, interactive study tools (flashcards, quizzes), and personalized conclusions highlights a need for a highly focused and effective learning environment within the web application. The 'Liam' reference suggests a strong integration with existing study group dynamics and external expert input.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Interactive Flashcards & Quizzing (Foundation)

- Rationale: Provides immediate value for students for active recall and self-assessment, which are fundamental to effective learning and exam preparation. Builds on existing expectations for learning platforms.
- Next steps: Define user stories for viewing, creating, and quizzing with flashcards. Design UI/UX for quiz interaction and answer submission.
- Resources needed: UI/UX designer, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer.
- Timeline: Short to Medium-term (e.g., 4-6 weeks for MVP).

#### #2 Priority: Exam-Focused Conclusion Builder

- Rationale: Directly addresses the user's need for distilling information for exams and improving memorization. Offers a unique value proposition for structured study.
- Next steps: Explore methods for inputting text fragments and mechanisms for guiding students to synthesize conclusions. Consider features for linking conclusions to specific exam topics.
- Resources needed: UI/UX designer, NLP/AI specialist (for synthesis guidance), Frontend Developer, Backend Developer.
- Timeline: Medium-term (e.g., 8-12 weeks for initial version).

#### #3 Priority: Curated & Relevant Quiz Questions (Liam Integration)

- Rationale: Leverages existing 'study group' expertise (Liam) to provide highly relevant and targeted assessment, directly contributing to exam focus and better memorization.
- Next steps: Define API or integration points with 'Liam' system/process to pull relevant quiz questions. Specify criteria for question relevance.
- Resources needed: Backend Developer, Data Engineer (for Liam integration), UI/UX designer (for question presentation).
- Timeline: Medium to Long-term (e.g., 10-16 weeks).

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

*   The user provided clear and detailed vision for the core functionalities related to exam preparation, flashcards, quizzes, and learning points.
*   Mind Mapping helped structure the user's abstract needs into concrete interaction points.

### Areas for Further Exploration

*   Details on "Liam" - who/what is Liam, and how exactly will questions be "taken out" from them? This needs clarification for implementation.
*   The exact mechanics of "Input fragments from learning materials" and "Synthesize into conclusions" require deeper exploration. How will the system aid this synthesis?

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

*   **Five Whys (Deep)**: To delve into the root causes of current learning challenges that these features aim to solve.
*   **What If Scenarios (Creative)**: To explore radical possibilities for how "Liam" could integrate or how "Key Learning Points" could be presented in innovative ways.

### Questions That Emerged

*   What are the technical constraints or existing infrastructure of the web application that might influence these features?
*   Are there specific types of learning materials (e.g., PDFs, videos, text) that students will be extracting information from?
*   How will "relevance" be defined for quiz questions and key learning points?

### Next Session Planning

- **Suggested topics:** Deep dive into "Liam" integration and the "Conclusion Builder" mechanics.
- **Recommended timeframe:** Within the next 1-2 weeks.
- **Preparation needed:** User to prepare examples of "Liam's" input and desired output for quiz questions; user to think about the ideal workflow for creating conclusions.
