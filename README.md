# The AI Helping Tool

This repository contains the project files for "The AI Helping Tool," an AI-powered study partner designed to dramatically improve learning efficiency.

## Vision

The vision is to create an indispensable study companion for high school, university, and adult learners. At its heart, the tool will be a "Zero-Friction Instant Clarity Engine." Users will be able to input any piece of study material—be it a photo of an assignment, a confusing paragraph of text, or a voice note about a problem—and receive an immediate, concise, and actionable next step.

For more information, see the [Product Brief](docs/product-brief-The%20AI%20Helping%20Tool-2025-12-04.md).

## Architecture

The system will be composed of three main components:

1.  **Mobile Application (Client):** A native mobile application for iOS and Android that provides the user interface for the tool.
2.  **Backend (Server):** A cloud-based backend that handles the business logic, AI processing, and data storage.
3.  **AI Service:** A third-party AI service that provides the text, image, and audio processing capabilities.

For more information, see the [Architecture Document](docs/architecture.md).

## Project Plan

The project is now ready for implementation. The first sprint will focus on setting up the development environment and implementing a basic version of the "Core 'Instant Clarity' Experience."

For more information, see the [Project Plan](docs/project-plan.md).

## Workflow Status

The current status of the project can be found in the [BMM Workflow Status](docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml) file.
