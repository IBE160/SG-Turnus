## Case Title
THE AI HELPING TOOL

## Background
Students often struggle to study efficiently due to the large amount of curriculum, numerous assignments, and limited time. Many find it difficult to stay organized, manage deadlines, and understand complex topics on their own.Traditional study methods, such as manual summarizing and note-taking, can be time-consuming and inconsistent. With advances in AI technology, there is now an opportunity to make studying more structured and interactive through automated tools.
## Purpose
helping students plan their curriculum , summarize difficult material, and offer instant feedback or explanations when needed. With an AI assistant available 24/7, students can learn at their own pace, improve productivity, and reduce stress related to academic pressure. The goal of this app is to support students in processing and understanding their course material by automatically creating summaries, flashcards, and quiz questions from uploaded notes. The application offers an effective learning aid while introducing students to practical uses of AI in text analysis

## Target Users
University and college students who want to improve study efficiency and learning outcomes. 
Students preparing for exams or revising large amounts of material. 
Educators who want to create study materials for their courses


## Core Functionality
Curriculum planning helps students organize and plan their studies efficiently.
Summarization  automatically creates concise summaries of complex material.
Instant feedback and explanations  provides quick answers to questions or clarifies difficult topics.
24/7 availability  offers continuous learning support anytime.
Automatic flashcard and quiz generation turns uploaded notes into interactive study tools.
AI-based text analysis  introduces students to practical applications of artificial intelligence in learning.
The AI analyzes uploaded study materials to automatically create summaries, flashcards, and quizzes from the curriculum. These tools help students learn more effectively and can be shared with classmates and teachers to encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing. Users can edit, save, and reuse study guides as needed. The system ensures secure data handling, with options for both local and cloud-based processing.

### Must Have (MVP)
- Feature 1: [The system should enable cloud-based processing to support efficient data sharing and collaboration between users. To achieve this, all uploaded study materials and generated content (such as summaries, flashcards, and quizzes) should be securely stored in a cloud environment. Process these materials on remote servers to ensure high performance and scalability, especially when handling large datasets or complex computations.

User accounts should be linked to a cloud storage service that allows authorized access to study materials across devices. This setup enables users to edit, save, and share their content with other such as classmates or teachers through controlled access permissions. Secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS and data encryption) must be implemented to protect data integrity and confidentiality during transfer and storage.

The cloud-based processing module should also synchronize user progress and updates in real time, ensuring that all participants have access to the latest versions of shared materials.]

- Feature 2: [To ensure a personalized and secure learning experience, users are required to create an account within the system. Account creation enables access to key functionalities such as cloud-based storage, synchronization of study materials, and collaborative sharing features.

When registering, users provide basic information (e.g., name, email, and institutional affiliation) to establish their unique profile. This account links the user to their personal workspace, where uploaded materials, generated summaries, flashcards, and quizzes are stored securely in the cloud.

Authentication mechanisms (such as email verification or single sign-on through educational institutions) are implemented to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. Once the account is created, users can access their study materials from any device, collaborate with peers and instructors, and maintain a continuous learning environment.]

- Feature 3: [The system should store all processed data, including summaries, flashcards, and quiz results, within a secure and structured database. Each users data must be linked to their account profile, allowing for easy retrieval, version control, and synchronization across devices. For cloud-enabled users, the results are stored in encrypted form on remote servers to ensure data availability and backup integrity.

The display module should present results through an intuitive user interface that allows users to view, filter, and organize their generated content. Summaries and flashcards should be displayed in a clean, readable format, with options to edit, tag, and categorize materials]

### Nice to Have (Optional Extensions)
- Feature 4: [Provides a clear overview of uploaded documents and generated materials, allowing users to easily access, organize, and manage their study content.]
- Feature 5: [Allows users to export or download generated materials such as summaries, flashcards, and quizzes in multiple formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, or CSV) for offline use or sharing outside the platform.]

## Data Requirements
- Data entity 1: [Attributes: name, email, password, login credentials, user preferences (language, detail level, AI settings)
Purpose: Identify and authenticate users; personalize generated study materials; control access to stored content]
- Data entity 2: [Attributes: uploaded documents (PDF, text, slides), course code, subject/module, upload date
Purpose: Source content for AI processing; provide reference for summaries, flashcards, and quiz questions]
- Data entity 3: [Attributes: summaries, flashcards (key concepts/terms), quiz questions/answers, reference markers (page numbers or sources), creation date
Purpose: Store processed output for user review, editing, saving, and optional sharing with peers]

## User Stories (Optional)
1. As a student, I want to review and edit generated flashcards, so that I can ensure the content matches my study style and understanding.
2. As a student, I want to save my generated study materials, so that I can access them later from any device.
3. As a student, I want to share flashcards or study guides with classmates, so that we can collaborate and reuse materials efficiently.

## Technical Constraints
- Must work on mobile phone so the user easy can learn on the go.
- Must be able to share the produced material
- All flashcard, ect must be possible to download to learn when offline.
- Must support user authentication and secure login to protect personal study materials.
- Must be able to process uploaded documents in formats like PDF, text, or slides.
- Must ensure data privacy and secure storage, both locally and in the cloud.
- Must provide a responsive interface that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Must be able to generate summaries, flashcards, and quizzes reliably using AI, even with large documents.
- Optional: Offline access to saved study materials (for reviewing without internet).

## Success Criteria
- Criterion 1: Users can upload study materials (PDF, slides, text) and receive automatically generated summaries, flashcards, and quiz questions.
- Criterion 2: Users can view, edit, and save their generated materials, with data persisting across sessions.
- Criterion 3: Users can securely log in and only access their own materials (privacy and access control are enforced).
- Criterion 4: Generated learning materials are accurate, relevant, and match the requested detail level.
- Criterion 5: Users can share study guides or flashcards with classmates without issues.
