Validation Summary for Story 1.8: Basic SEO for Public Pages

**Outcome: FAIL** (Critical: 1, Major: 2, Minor: 2)

**Critical Issues (Blockers):**
-   **Missing "Learnings from Previous Story" subsection in Dev Notes:** Story 1.8's Dev Notes do not contain a "Learnings from Previous Story" subsection. This means critical context from the previous story (1.7) about cross-device synchronization was not incorporated.

**Major Issues (Should Fix):**
-   **Missing Dev Agent Record details from Previous Story (1.7):** The previous story (1.7) lacks 'Completion Notes' and 'File List' in its Dev Agent Record, meaning important context and learnings were unavailable.
-   **No coding-standards.md found or referenced:** Lack of a specific coding standards document can lead to inconsistencies, and no explicit reference was found in Dev Notes.

**Minor Issues (Nice to Have):**
-   **Minimal "Project Structure Notes" due to missing `unified-project-structure.md`:** The subsection is present but minimal, highlighting the absence of a dedicated document.
-   **Fewer explicit testing subtasks than ACs:** While tasks are linked to ACs, one less explicit testing subtask than ACs was identified.

**Path to saved report:** `docs/sprint-artifacts/validation-report-2025-12-17.md`

I recommend addressing these issues before proceeding. Would you like me to attempt to fix these issues in Story 1.8, or would you prefer to do it manually?
